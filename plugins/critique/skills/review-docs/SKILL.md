# Documentation Review

Review documentation in the specified path (default: entire repository).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Consult [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the expected output format and level of detail.

## Scope

Determine the review scope before discovering files:

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, treat it as a path (file or directory) and run:
  ```bash
  ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/discover-files.sh "$ARGUMENTS"
  ```
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, scope to files added or modified on the current branch relative to the default branch:
  ```bash
  ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/discover-files.sh
  ```

Handle the script's exit codes:
- **0 with output** — use the listed paths as input to the discovery step below.
- **0 with empty output** — branch has no diff vs the default branch. Tell the user and ask which path to review.
- **non-zero** — script prints a message to stderr (path not found, not a git repo, on the default branch with no path, detached HEAD, or default branch indeterminate). Relay the message and ask the user which path to review.

The script returns paths language-blind. The discovery step below filters to README.md and CLAUDE.md files; this filter is universal across languages so a fallback is rarely needed.

## Workflow

1. Run deterministic validation script for structural issues (always repo-wide — structural drift outside the branch scope still matters)
2. Find README and CLAUDE.md files in the script's output
3. Evaluate against quality criteria
4. Cross-reference enumerations in docs against codebase sources of truth (see Enumeration Completeness)
5. Produce the findings report

### Deterministic Validation

Before manual review, run the validation script for CLAUDE.md structural issues. Pass the repo root so structural problems anywhere in the repo are caught regardless of branch scope:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/review-docs/scripts/validate-claude-md.py . --json
```

Parse the JSON output and include structural issues (missing tables, missing references, index drift) in your findings. The script checks:
- Presence of markdown tables with required columns
- Whether referenced files/directories exist
- Index drift (files not indexed, or index entries pointing to missing files)
- `@path` import targets resolve to existing files
- `.claude/rules/` file structure, frontmatter globs, and empty files
- Leaked local preferences (hardcoded user paths, localhost URLs) in shared CLAUDE.md

## Quality Criteria

### Structure (Progressive Disclosure)

README.md files belong at **component boundaries** — the repo root plus the top-level directory of each major component (e.g., `frontend/`, `backend/`, `infra/`, `docs/`). Most subdirectories within a component should not have their own README. If a directory only needs a brief description and a pointer to its files, a CLAUDE.md index is sufficient.

**Root README.md**:
- Project purpose (why it exists)
- What it does (brief overview)
- Quick start instructions
- Links to component docs
- NO deep architectural details

**Component READMEs** (top-level component dirs only):
- Component's purpose in detail
- Architectural decisions
- Component-specific setup
- Internal APIs/interfaces

Do **not** flag missing READMEs in nested subdirectories (e.g., `src/utils/`, `lib/internal/`). Navigation within a component is handled by CLAUDE.md.

### Content Quality

- **Concise**: No unnecessary words or redundancy
- **Clear**: Jargon explained, unambiguous
- **Accurate**: Examples work, paths exist, commands valid, lists reflect what actually exists in code
- **Complete**: Prerequisites listed, all steps included, enumerations cover all items (see Enumeration Completeness below)
- **Consistent**: Uniform terminology and formatting
- **Internally consistent**: Numbers, counts, and facts agree across all mentions within the same document

Content Quality applies primarily to README prose. For CLAUDE.md, focus on accuracy (index entries point to real files) and consistency (uniform table format).

### Enumeration Completeness

When documentation contains a list of things — components, features, agents, services, environment variables, log files, database tables, API endpoints — verify the list is **complete and accurate** by cross-referencing the codebase.

**Workflow**:
1. Identify every enumeration in the docs (any list that claims to describe "all" or "the" items of a type)
2. Find the canonical source in code (e.g., config directory for agents, env template for env vars, schema definitions for DB tables)
3. Diff the two: items in code but missing from docs, items in docs but removed from code
4. Flag gaps as P3 (stale or incomplete)

**Common patterns to cross-reference**:
- Agent/service/component lists → config files or directory listings
- Feature/capability lists → tool, handler, or route files
- Environment variable documentation → `.env.example`, `.env.template`, or equivalent
- Log file lists → logging configuration entries
- Database table/schema documentation → schema definition files or migrations
- CLI command/Makefile target documentation → actual command definitions

**What to skip**: Exhaustive enumeration is not always expected. Use judgement — a "Key features" section need not list every minor capability. But a section titled "Agents" or "Configuration" that presents itself as comprehensive should be complete.

### Hidden Knowledge

Good docs surface things newcomers can't discover on their own. Flag when these are missing:

**Prerequisites & Environment**:
- System dependencies (e.g., "requires Docker 20+", "needs libssl-dev on Linux")
- Required tool versions (node, python, go, etc.)
- Required accounts or API keys (with signup links, not the keys themselves)
- Environment variables with example values (use `YOUR_API_KEY` placeholders)

**Platform Differences**:
- OS-specific instructions when behavior differs (Mac vs Linux vs Windows)
- Architecture notes if relevant (ARM vs x86)

**Gotchas & Failure Modes**:
- Common setup errors and fixes ("If you see X, run Y")
- Non-obvious side effects ("This command also resets the database")
- Known limitations or unsupported scenarios

**Magic Values**:
- Default ports, timeouts, limits that aren't obvious from code
- Config file locations that vary by platform
- Implicit ordering dependencies ("Run A before B")

### Quick Start Quality

The quick start should let someone succeed in minutes, not hours. Evaluate:

**Copy-Pasteable Commands**:
- Commands can be copied and run verbatim (no unexplained `<placeholders>`)
- If placeholders are needed, explain how to get the real value
- Shell-specific syntax noted if it matters (bash vs zsh vs fish)

**Expected Output**:
- Show what success looks like ("You should see: ...")
- Include sample output for key commands
- Note how to verify it worked

**Minimal Path**:
- Doesn't require reading other sections first
- Optional features clearly marked as optional
- "Hello world" possible before diving into configuration

**First-Run Troubleshooting**:
- Top 2-3 things that go wrong on first run
- One-liner fixes for each
- Link to more detailed troubleshooting if it exists

### CLAUDE.md Navigation Index

CLAUDE.md files provide progressive disclosure via tabular indexes, pointing readers to the right file at the right time. README.md holds invisible knowledge (architecture, design decisions, invariants); CLAUDE.md holds navigation.

> CLAUDE.md conventions inspired by solatis/claude-config (MIT).

**Coverage** — Non-trivial directories should have a CLAUDE.md. Skip generated dirs, vendored deps, stubs (`.gitkeep` only), `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `dist`, `build`, and similar. Also skip `CLAUDE.local.md` and `MEMORY.md` — these are personal/auto-managed and not part of shared project documentation.

**Tabular index format** — Each CLAUDE.md must contain at least one markdown table with columns: `File` (or `Directory`), `What`, `When to read`. Entries should use:
- Backtick-wrapped file/directory names (e.g., `` `src/` ``)
- Noun-based "What" descriptions (e.g., "Entry point", "Test utilities")
- Action-verb "When to read" triggers (e.g., "Adding a new route", "Debugging test failures")

**Content separation (subdirectory CLAUDE.md only)** — Subdirectory CLAUDE.md files should contain only:
- A one-sentence overview of the directory's purpose
- One or more tabular indexes

They should **not** contain architecture explanations, design decisions, invariants, or multi-paragraph prose. That content belongs in README.md.

**Root CLAUDE.md operational sections** — The root CLAUDE.md may additionally contain operational sections (Build, Test, Lint commands), agent instruction sections (e.g., beads workflow, tool configuration), and other project-wide guidance. This is expected and should not be flagged.

### CLAUDE.md Progressive Disclosure

**Detail belongs where the code lives.** CLAUDE.md depth should match directory depth. The goal is to minimize context loading at each level — an AI working in `internal/cloud/aws/` should not need to read the entire root CLAUDE.md to understand that directory.

The hierarchy works as follows:
- **Root CLAUDE.md**: Navigation index + dev commands. Just enough to find where to go.
- **Branch CLAUDE.md** (e.g., `internal/cloud/`): Architecture and patterns for that area + index to children.
- **Leaf CLAUDE.md** (e.g., `internal/cloud/aws/`): Implementation specifics for that directory.

**Anti-pattern**: A root CLAUDE.md that contains multi-paragraph explanations of how `internal/cloud/` works, what patterns `internal/broker/` uses, or how `test/` is structured. That detail should live in the respective subdirectory CLAUDE.md files, not the root.

**What root CLAUDE.md should contain**:
- Project overview (1-2 sentences)
- Tabular navigation index pointing to major areas
- Build/test/lint commands
- Agent workflow instructions (if applicable)
- Common gotchas (brief, not exhaustive)

**What root CLAUDE.md should NOT contain**:
- Multi-paragraph architecture explanations for subdirectories
- Implementation patterns specific to a component
- Detailed testing approaches (belongs in `test/CLAUDE.md`)
- Provider-specific details (belongs in provider directories)

**Index drift** — Flag when:
- A file or subdirectory exists in the directory but is missing from the CLAUDE.md index (excluding dotfiles, generated artifacts, and files covered by glob patterns in the index)
- An index entry references a file or directory that does not exist
- A CLAUDE.md index links to a README that doesn't exist, or a README references a component whose CLAUDE.md is missing

**Misplaced detail** — Flag when:
- Root CLAUDE.md contains multi-paragraph explanations about subdirectory internals
- Architectural detail about a component appears in the root instead of that component's CLAUDE.md
- A branch directory lacks a CLAUDE.md but its detail is front-loaded in a parent CLAUDE.md

### CLAUDE.md Imports (`@path` Syntax)

CLAUDE.md files can import other files using `@path/to/file` syntax. The skill validates these references:

- Import target must exist (P2 if missing)
- Relative paths resolve relative to the containing file's directory
- Maximum 5 hops for recursive imports (A imports B imports C...); flag deeper chains as P3
- Circular imports are P2
- Imports inside fenced code blocks and inline code spans are not evaluated — do not flag them
- Exclude email addresses (user@example.com), npm scopes (`@org/pkg`), and social handles (`@username`) from import checking

### `.claude/rules/` Directory

The `.claude/rules/` directory contains per-topic rule files that scope instructions to specific file paths. Do not flag an absent `.claude/rules/` directory — it is optional.

- Each file should cover one topic (P4 if unfocused)
- Filenames should be descriptive — flag generic names like `rules.md`, `misc.md` (P4)
- `paths` frontmatter: P2 for invalid glob syntax, P3 for globs matching no files, P4 if universal rules are unnecessarily scoped to specific paths
- Flag duplication between rules files and CLAUDE.md (P3)

### Memory Location Awareness

**`.claude/CLAUDE.md` alternative** — Both `./CLAUDE.md` and `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` are valid project instruction locations. Do not flag the choice of one over the other. Check both locations when reviewing.

**`CLAUDE.local.md` (personal, not reviewed)** — `CLAUDE.local.md` contains personal preferences and is gitignored. Do not flag it as missing. Do not review its content. Flag personal/local preferences leaked into shared CLAUDE.md as P3 (hardcoded user home paths like `/Users/<name>/`, `/home/<name>/`, `C:\Users\<name>\`; personal sandbox URLs; machine-specific values).

**`MEMORY.md` / auto memory (excluded)** — Files in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/` including `MEMORY.md` are managed by Claude Code directly. The skill must:
- Not suggest changes to MEMORY.md
- Not flag it for any criteria
- Not recommend creating or restructuring it
- Skip it entirely during discovery

### Instruction Specificity

Instructions in CLAUDE.md and `.claude/rules/` should be specific and actionable. Flag vague directives as P4:
- "follow best practices"
- "write clean code"
- "use appropriate naming"
- "ensure quality"

Do not flag intentionally high-level guidance that communicates a genuine design preference (e.g., "prefer composition over inheritance", "use dependency injection for external services").

### Formatting Best Practices

Instructions should be structured for fast scanning:
- Instructions should use bullet points, not prose paragraphs (P4)
- Related bullets should be grouped under descriptive headings — flag 10+ ungrouped consecutive items (P4)

Applies to CLAUDE.md and `.claude/rules/` instruction content only. Does not apply to tabular indexes, README prose, or code block sections.

## Output

You MUST produce a report following the exact structure shown in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

**Severity guide**:
- **P1** — Security-relevant: docs omit auth steps, expose secrets in examples, or give dangerous command examples
- **P2** — Broken: code examples that error, paths/commands that don't exist, quick start fails on copy-paste, index entries pointing to missing files, broken `@path` imports, circular imports, invalid glob syntax in rules frontmatter
- **P3** — Stale or incomplete: outdated references, missing prerequisites, missing env var docs, missing CLAUDE.md coverage, index drift, no expected output shown, misplaced detail (architecture in root instead of subdirectory CLAUDE.md), enumeration gaps (components/features/env vars in code but missing from docs), internal fact contradictions within the same document, leaked local preferences in shared CLAUDE.md, orphan globs in rules frontmatter, duplication between rules files and CLAUDE.md, import chains exceeding 5 hops
- **P4** — Polish: formatting inconsistencies, verbose wording, missing "When to read" triggers, missing platform-specific notes, vague instructions ("follow best practices"), generic rule filenames, ungrouped instruction lists, unnecessarily scoped universal rules

Each finding MUST include:

- **Priority** (P1/P2/P3/P4) in the H3 header
- **Location** (file:line, or just filename if no specific line)
- **Explanation** of the problem or missing content and why it matters
- **Fix** — concrete prescription of exactly what to change or add
- **Done when** — a verifiable criterion checkable by reading the file. For errors: "The link at README.md:45 resolves to an existing file." For missing content: "The Quick Start section lists the minimum required Docker version with a link to the install page." NOT: "The docs are accurate."
